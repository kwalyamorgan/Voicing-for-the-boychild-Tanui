                        <h3>Founder & CEO</h3>
                        <p><strong>Background:</strong> Emmanuel Tanui is a dedicated community leader and social entrepreneur from Maramoja Village in Laikipia County, Kenya. With a deep understanding of the challenges faced by rural communities, particularly young boys and men, Emmanuel founded Boyhood Echo Organisation to address the critical issues of boy child welfare and community development.</p>

                        <p><strong>Vision & Ambitions:</strong> "My ambition is to create a world where every boy child has the opportunity to grow into a responsible, empowered man who contributes positively to his community. I envision Boyhood Echo becoming a model organization that not only addresses immediate needs but also builds sustainable systems for long-term change in rural Kenya."</p>

                        <p><strong>His Comments on the Work:</strong> "The boy child crisis in our communities is real and urgent. Many boys are growing up without proper guidance, mentorship, or opportunities for development. Through Boyhood Echo, we're not just providing immediate support – we're building a foundation for generational change. Every program we implement, every boy we reach, represents hope for a better future."</p>

                        <p><strong>Personal Motivation:</strong> Having witnessed firsthand the struggles of boys in his community, Emmanuel was inspired to take action. "I grew up in these same villages and saw how lack of opportunities and guidance affected so many young lives. I made a commitment to myself and my community that I would work tirelessly to ensure that no boy has to face these challenges alone."</p>

                        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong> Under Emmanuel's leadership, Boyhood Echo has successfully implemented community-based programs that have reached hundreds of boys across Laikipia County. His approach combines traditional community values with modern development strategies, creating programs that are both culturally relevant and effective.</p>

                        <p><strong>Future Goals:</strong> Emmanuel aims to expand Boyhood Echo's reach beyond Laikipia County, establishing partnerships with other organizations and government bodies to create a nationwide network of boy child support programs. He also plans to develop training programs for community leaders and mentors across Kenya.</p>
